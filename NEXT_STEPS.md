# Next Steps - BostonTec Stress Testing

## Immediate Priority
- **Deploy latest HTML report with working visualizations** to GitHub Pages
- **Test the complete system** with fresh 5-iteration run

## Quick Setup
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Stash uncommitted files and deploy
git stash
python deploy_reports.py
git stash pop
```

## This Week's Tasks
- ‚úÖ **Fix data mismatch issue** - RESOLVED
- ‚úÖ **Fix report logic inconsistencies** - RESOLVED  
- ‚úÖ **Implement visualizations** - COMPLETED (but limited value with current data scale)
- ‚úÖ **Fix blank chart rendering issue** - RESOLVED
- üîÑ **Deploy working visualizations** - IN PROGRESS
- ‚è≥ **Run comprehensive 5-iteration test** - PENDING
- üí° **Evaluate visualization value at larger scale** - NEW INSIGHT

## Current Status
- **Core System:** ‚úÖ Fully functional
- **HTML Reports:** ‚úÖ Working with HTML/CSS visualizations
- **Chart Rendering:** ‚úÖ Fixed (switched from Chart.js to HTML/CSS due to CDN issues)
- **GitHub Pages:** üîÑ Needs deployment of latest report
- **Data Accuracy:** ‚úÖ Consistent between JSON and HTML reports

## Technical Notes
- **Chart.js Issue:** CDN loading failed due to network restrictions
- **Solution:** Implemented pure HTML/CSS visualizations (bar charts, tables)
- **Visualizations Working:** Memory timeline, performance trends, error analysis
- **Chart Layout:** Fixed overflow issue by limiting to 15 data points max
- **Value Assessment:** Current visualizations don't add significant narrative value with limited data scale
- **Future Consideration:** Visualizations may be more valuable with larger test runs (20+ iterations)

## Long Term Goals
- **Evaluate visualization value at larger scale** (20+ iterations) before investing in advanced features
- **Lead generation form automation**
- **Canvas-to-blob logging integration** (when developer implements)
- **Advanced chart analytics** (only if proven valuable at scale)
- **Real-time monitoring dashboard** (only if proven valuable at scale)
