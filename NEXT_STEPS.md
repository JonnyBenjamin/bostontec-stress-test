# Next Steps - BostonTec Stress Testing

## Immediate Priority
- **Deploy latest HTML report with working visualizations** to GitHub Pages
- **Test the complete system** with fresh 5-iteration run

## Quick Setup
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Stash uncommitted files and deploy
git stash
python deploy_reports.py
git stash pop
```

## This Week's Tasks
- ‚úÖ **Fix data mismatch issue** - RESOLVED
- ‚úÖ **Fix report logic inconsistencies** - RESOLVED  
- ‚úÖ **Implement visualizations** - COMPLETED with 100-run varied data
- ‚úÖ **Fix blank chart rendering issue** - RESOLVED
- ‚úÖ **Improve memory visualization** - COMPLETED (100 runs, accurate risk levels)
- ‚úÖ **Clean up project files** - COMPLETED (organized archive structure)
- ‚úÖ **Deploy working visualizations** - COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ **Run comprehensive 5-iteration test** - COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ **Begin scalable architecture refactor** - COMPLETED (Phase 1)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Pause refactor work** - PAUSED (ready to resume)

## Current Status
- **Core System:** ‚úÖ Fully functional
- **HTML Reports:** ‚úÖ Working with HTML/CSS visualizations
- **Chart Rendering:** ‚úÖ Fixed (switched from Chart.js to HTML/CSS due to CDN issues)
- **GitHub Pages:** üîÑ Needs deployment of latest report
- **Data Accuracy:** ‚úÖ Consistent between JSON and HTML reports

## Technical Notes
- **Chart.js Issue:** CDN loading failed due to network restrictions
- **Solution:** Implemented pure HTML/CSS visualizations (scatter plots, tables)
- **Visualizations Working:** 100-run memory scatter plot with color-coded risk levels
- **Memory Analysis:** Realistic varied data (72 green, 22 yellow, 6 red dots)
- **Risk Assessment:** Individual metric evaluation (HIGH for ‚â•50%, MEDIUM for 35-49%, LOW for <35%)
- **File Organization:** Clean archive structure with organized historical data
- **Value Assessment:** Visualizations now provide meaningful insights with 100-run dataset

## Refactor Status (PAUSED)
- **Phase 1 Complete:** ‚úÖ New scalable architecture structure created
- **Core Modules:** ‚úÖ TestEngine, BrowserManager, DataCollector, ConfigLoader, TestExecutor
- **CLI Interface:** ‚úÖ Working command-line interface
- **Configuration System:** ‚úÖ Multi-customer config support
- **Test Results:** ‚úÖ Architecture works, minor selector issue to fix
- **Next Phase:** Fix selector issue and complete integration testing

## Long Term Goals
- **Evaluate visualization value at larger scale** (20+ iterations) before investing in advanced features
- **Lead generation form automation**
- **Canvas-to-blob logging integration** (when developer implements)
- **Advanced chart analytics** (only if proven valuable at scale)
- **Real-time monitoring dashboard** (only if proven valuable at scale)
